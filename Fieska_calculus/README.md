# Fieska_calculus

Fieska-calculus augments SF-calculus with operators 


K, I, A and E.

K and I are from combinatory logic. The operator A is used to delay
application of M to N, according to the rule

AMNP = MNP 

E decides equality of combinations. 

See ../SF-calculus/deconstruction.pdf for details.
