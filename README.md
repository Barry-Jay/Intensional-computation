# Intensional-computation
Translations of a lambda abstraction to combinations of operators, with proofs written in Coq.


Closure_calculus contains the variant of lambda-calculus. 
SF-calculus contains SF calculus (see also the repository SF).
Fieska-calculus augments SF-calculus with more operators. 
Closure_to_Fieska translates closure calculus to Fieska-calculus. 
Closure_to_SF translates closure calculus to SF-calculus. 

_CoqProject and the make files should (re-)construct the proofs. 
If there are problems, consult the script.
