# Intensional-computation
Translations of a lambda abstraction to combinations of operators, with proofs written in Coq.


Closure_calculus contains the variant of lambda-calculus. 
SF-calculus contains SF calculus (see also the repository SF).
Fieska-calculus augments SF-calculus with more operators. 
Closure_to_Fieska translates closure calculus to Fieska-calculus. 
Closure_to_SF translates closure calculus to SF-calculus.

Tree_calculus introduces tree calculus. The main theorems are:

- translation_preserves_sf_reduction
- translation_preserves_abs_reduction 
- eager_is_definable


_CoqProject and the make files and script are all out of date.
