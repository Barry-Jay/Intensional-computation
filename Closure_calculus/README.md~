# Closure_calculus

The calculus is described in Closure_calculus.pdf.
It generalizes the usual lambda abstractions to become *closures* 
of the form 

lambda x xs sigma t 

where x xs is a non-empty sequence of bound variables, and sigma is an
explicit substitution. 


A key feature of this calculus is that reduction does not need to keep
track of scopes in any way; no knowledge of free and bound variables,
scopes or variable re-naming is required. This is a key step towards
converting abstractions into combinations of operators.
