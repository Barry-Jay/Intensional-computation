# Closure_to_Fieska

Translating closure calculus to Fieska-calculus. See ../SF-calculus/deconstruction.pdf for details. The translation of the identity abstraction uses 

8030 

operators, which is better than 98140 operators in SF-calculus. In
turn, this can be optimized to 1 operator, I in Optimization.v by
using a variant of the eta-rule of lambda-calculus. Details can be
found in the paper "Recursive Programs in Normal Form" (rpnf.pdf).
