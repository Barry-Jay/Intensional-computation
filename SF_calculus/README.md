# SF_calculus

SF-calculus is here used to build some combinations to represent the various
term forms of closure calculus. These will be used in the repository ../Closure_to_SF to perform a translation. A gentler approach uses ../Fieska-calculus to do the same thing. 

See deconstruction.pdf for details.
